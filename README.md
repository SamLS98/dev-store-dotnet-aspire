# DevStore - A microservices e-commerce reference application built with ASP.NET 8

A real-world reference application powered by [desenvolvedor.io](https://desenvolvedor.io/) <img alt="Brasil" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5068797/161345649-c7184fdc-2bc3-42a9-8fb6-6ffee9c8f9c2.png" width="20" height="14" /> implementing the most common and used technologies to share with the technical community the best way to develop full and complex applications with .NET

---

###### This project was inspired by [EShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers), however the real motivation was to build it by "our way".

###### The EShopOnContainers is an awesome project, however the code has some "bad smells". We found it difficult to start learning/using EShopOnContainers compared to DevStore. We like to think of the DevStore as a simplified (but no less complex) version and written with more care in code and small details. We also focused only on the Web architecture with ASP.NET.

## Architecture:

### Complete architecture implementing the most important and used concerns as:

- Hexagonal Architecture
- Clean Code
- Clean Architecture
- DDD - Domain Driven Design (Layers and Domain Model Pattern)
- Domain Events
- Domain Notification
- Domain Validations
- CQRS (Imediate Consistency)
- Retry Pattern
- Circuit Breaker
- Unit of Work
- Repository
- Specification Pattern
- API Gateway / BFF

---

## Architecture Overview

### The entire application is based in an unique solution with 7 API's and one web application (MVC)

This is a reference application, each microservice has its own database and represents a bounded context (DDD concept).
There is a BFF / API Gateway to manage the Basket / Order / Payment requests and data structure from responses.

## Getting Started
You can run the DevStore project on any operating system. **Make sure you have installed docker in your environment.** ([Get Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

Clone DevStore repository and navigate to the **/Docker** folder and then:

### If you just want run the DevStore application in your Docker enviroment:

```
docker-compose up
```

### If you want to build the local images and run the DevStore application in your Docker enviroment:

This compose will provide one database container each API service.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up --build
```

### If you prefer save machine resources use the light local compose:

This compose will provide just one database container for all API services.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local-light.yml up --build
```
---

### If you want run locally with Visual Studio:

You will need:
- Docker

### If you want Visual Studio with F5 and debug experience:

- You will need at least Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 8.
- The latest SDK and tools can be downloaded from https://dot.net/core
- Set **DevStore.AppHost** as the starting project and hit F5

## Disclaimer
- This is not an architectural template or bootstrap model for new apps
- All implementations were made for the real world, but the goal is to share knowledge
- Maybe you don't need many implementations included, try to avoid **over-engineering**
